# PortMapper
A simple project i made for my networking classes.

The main goal for this project was to help us somewhat understand the innerworkings of DNS servers.

What this does is after starting both of the servers (Adder and PortMapper) the PortMapper is supposed to save the IP address and number of the port under a specific name and then be able to handle client request based on the previously saved names.
